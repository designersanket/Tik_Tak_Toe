# Tik_Tak_Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns to mark a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O." The goal is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. This game includes two modes: one where players input moves in the terminal and another where players interact with a graphical interface using Tkinter.
